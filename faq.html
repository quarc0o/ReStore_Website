                        <p>All these goods were donated by past students to help you out. 
                            We ask that you pay it forward by bringing the items back when 
                            you're done with them :)
                        </p>
                        <p>We are also lucky to have generous support from the Velferdstinget 
                          and Sit Bolig (including the facilities and van).

                        <p>Check <a href="#">our Facebook page</a>  for updated information. Due to COVID, we have changed 
                            how we receive donations at ReStore. Now you can drop off at anytime, contact 
                            free, on the back porch of the kindergarten. Simply take a photo of your donation 
                            when you drop it off and send us in a message with date and time. Our volunteers 
                            will bring it inside after 72 hours.
